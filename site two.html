    <p>Just myself and our founder Obama exploring this vast world and its secrets. We have come up with possibly the best pre workout formula of all time and already have many influencers taking it. However, it was not always this way and we began our adventure making websites just as this one. We both had much success doing that also. However, a few years ago we gave up on making websites and turned to a quickly growing industry. Many people in today's day and age have began working out to burn that fat off they gained during quarantine and have also started taking pre workout.</p>
    <p> In the beginning of our process we had a hard time making a product that wouldn't only taste good, however, work just as good or better than those products that have been out for a lot longer. With the help of a few scientists we were able to make a complete model of our product in virtual reality. With the virtual reality it helped us tremendously by helping show us the complete process the pre workout does inside the body and what organs we should concentrate on. In only a few months we were able to get a complete prototype and gave some to famous people to try it out. </p>
